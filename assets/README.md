# Profile Photo Setup

## How to add your profile photo:

1. **Save your photo as:** `profile-photo.jpg`
2. **Place it in this folder:** `assets/`
3. **Recommended specifications:**
   - **Format:** JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - **Size:** 400x400 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio)
   - **File size:** Under 500KB for optimal loading speed
   - **Quality:** High resolution for crisp display

## Alternative file formats:
If you prefer a different format, you can update the `src` attribute in `index.html`:
- For PNG: Change `assets/profile-photo.jpg` to `assets/profile-photo.png`
- For WebP: Change `assets/profile-photo.jpg` to `assets/profile-photo.webp`

## Fallback behavior:
- If the image file is missing or fails to load, a user icon will be displayed instead
- The styling will maintain the Apple Liquid Glass design with gradient background

## Tips for best results:
- Use a professional headshot with good lighting
- Ensure your face is centered in the image
- A neutral or slightly positive expression works best
- Consider the circular crop when framing your photo
